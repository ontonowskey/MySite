        <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>

        <p>
            I was born in the village near town Ulan-Ude, The Republic of Buryatia (It's a part of Russian Federation, if you didn't know. 
            When i first visited Moscow, i was amazed how many people don't know about this thing. That's why I say) in 2001.
            I was an average schoolchild, plays Warcraft 3 Multiplayer and other games in free time from school. 
            At school teachers and high school students always predicted that I would be a programmer. <br/>
            Because I spent a lot of time on the computer... But no one ever tried to interest me for this thing 
            besides, I was smarter then everyone else in interacting with the computer. I didn't see where to expand my skills.
            <strong>Hostage of expectations.</strong> Finally, I finished school after ninth grade, and went to study as programmer.
            I got no interest here, whatever <strong>it was the only evolve step that I have seen.</strong> <br />
            Until in the third year of study I developed a course project, just not to be expelled. Thereafter I was fascinated by a development! <br />
            <strong> Since then, my main goal is to become a real .NET C# developer in any area of development, whether it WEB, Software, or Gamedev. </strong> <br />
            I want to progress and work, i sense, that is the work of my life. Even though I still don't know much about it. <br/><br/>
            
            Thank you for reading this, i appreciate that.
